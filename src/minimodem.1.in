.SH NAME
minimodem \- general-purpose software audio FSK modem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minimodem --tx
.RI [ options ]
.I {baudmode}
.br
.B minimodem --rx
.RI [ options ]
.I {baudmode}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Minimodem
is a command-line program which decodes (or generates) audio
modem tones at any specified baud rate, using various framing protocols.
It acts a general-purpose software FSK modem, and includes support for
various standard FSK protocols such as Bell103, Bell202, RTTY, TTY/TDD,
NOAA SAME, and Caller-ID.
.PP
.B Minimodem
can play and capture audio modem tones in real-time via the system
audio device, or in batched mode via audio files.
.PP
.B Minimodem
can be used to transfer data between nearby computers using an
audio cable (or just via sound waves), or between remote computers using
radio, telephone, or another audio communications medium.
.SH "TX/RX MODE"
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-tx, \-\-transmit, \-\-write
transmit mode: generate audio tones
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rx, \-\-receive,  \-\-read
receive mode: decode audio tones
.SH {baudmode}
The required \fI{baudmode}\fR parameter may be any floating-point value to
specify a baud rate, or any of the special keywords listed below.
The \fI{baudmode}\fR also implies certain other parameter defaults
depending on the rate, including standard (or at least reasonable)
default mark and space tone frequencies.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-auto-carrier
Automatically detect mark and space frequences from carrier.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-inverted
Invert the mark and space frequencies (applies whether the
frequencies are defaults, discovered by \-\-auto-carrier,
or specified manually).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-confidence min-confidence-threshold
Set receive confidence minimum threshold (default 1.5).
The "confidence" value is a metric based primarily on
the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the received signal.
This value acts as an FSK decoder "squelch" control.
Increase to accept only very clean signals (up to INFINITY, but
a value around 5.0 is more practical).  Decrease to accept partial
decoding of noisy signals (down to a minimum value of 1.0).
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.B \-l, \-\-limit max-confidence-search-limit
Set receive confidence maximum search limit (default 2.3).
The "confidence" value is as described above.
This value acts as a performance vs. analysis quality control.
Increase (up to INFINITY) for a more pedantic analysis
and higher CPU usage.  Decrease (down to the min-confidence-threshold)
for a sloppier analysis, with lower CPU usage.
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-8, \-\-ascii
ASCII  8\-N\-1
.TP
.B \-5, \-\-baudot
Baudot 5\-N\-1.5
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-file filename.wav
encode or decode an audio file (extension sets audio format)
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-bandwidth {rx_bandwidth}
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-volume {tx_amplitude or 'E'}
Sets the generated signal amplitude (default is 1.0).  As a special case
useful for testing, the value 'E' sets the amplitude to the very small value
FLT_EPSILON.  (This option applies to \-\-tx mode only).
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-mark {mark_freq}
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-space {space_freq}
.TP
.B \-\-startbits {n}
Sets the number of start bits (default is 1 for most baudmodes).
.TP
.B \-\-stopbits {n.n}
Sets the number of stop bits (default is 1.0 for most baudmodes).
.TP
.B \-\-sync-byte {0xXX}
If this option is used, initial carrier acquisition will be suppressed
until after one or more consecutive data frame(s) containing this value
are received.  This can be used to synchronize the stream for protocols
which include a fixed preamble byte.
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Do not report CARRIER / NOCARRIER or signal analysis metrics.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-samplerate {rate}
Set the audio sample rate (default rate is 48000 Hz).
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-alsa[={plughw:X,Y | X,Y | X }]
Use ALSA as the audio output system instead of the default
PulseAudio (depending on build configuration options).  The ALSA
device alias "default" is used, if a specific device is not specified.
For example, the following options all select ALSA device #1, sub-device #0:
 \-\-alsa=plughw:1,0  \-\-alsa=1,0  \-A1
.TP
.B \-\-lut={tx_sin_table_len}
Minimodem uses a precomputed sine wave lookup table of 1024 elements,
or the size specified here.  Use \-\-lut=0 to disable the use of
the sine wave lookup table.  (This option applies to \-\-tx mode only).
.TP
.B \-\-float-samples
Generate 32-bit floating-point format audio samples, instead of the
default 16-bit signed integer format (applies to \-\-tx mode only;
\-\-rx mode always uses 32-bit floating-point).
.TP
.B \-\-rx-one
Quit after the first carrier/no-carrier event (applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-\-binary-output
Print received data bits as raw binary output using characters '0' and '1'.
The bits are printed in the order they are received.  Framing bits (start
and stop bits) are omitted from the output.
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-\-binary-raw {nbits}
Print all received bits (data bits and any framing bits) as raw binary output
using characters '0' and '1'.  Framing bits are not interpreted, but simply
passed through to the output.  The bits are printed in the order they are
received, in lines {nbits} wide.  So in order to display a standard 8-N-1
bitstream (8 databits + 1 start bit + 1 stop bit), use "--binary-raw 10"
 or a multiple of 10.
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-\-print-filter
Filter the received text output, replacing any "non-printable" bytes
with a '.' character.
(This option applies to \-\-rx mode only).
.TP
.B \-\-print-eot
Print "### EOT" to stderr after each transmit completes.
.TP
.B \-\-tx-carrier
When transmitting from a blocking source, keep a carrier going while waiting
for more data.
.TP
.B \-\-benchmarks
Run and report internal performance tests (all other flags are ignored).
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
print program version
